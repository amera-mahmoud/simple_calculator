# simple_calculator
This calculator is capable of performing the four basic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), division (/), and multiplication (*). It is hardware-based, implemented using a PIC 16f877A, with an LCD for display and a keypad for input. The program starts by displaying a welcoming message on the LCD, then waits for the user to input the first operand, the operation, and the second operand. After that, the program executes the chosen operation and displays the result on the LCD. If the user fails to enter the expression in the correct order, the program will display an error message on the LCD.
